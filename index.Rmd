# Welkom to my portfolio
My name is Kjettil Evers and my portfolio is a representation of all that I've learned and accomplished using data science. 


This portfolio showcases my skills in different subjects using Rmarkdown and more!
each chapter contains a exercise that shows how i executed the exercise step by step. It also gives a view it shows the perspective of how I approached my assignments and why I made certain choices. 

All files in this bookdown are available in my [github](https://github.com/kjettil/kjettil.github.io)




```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
